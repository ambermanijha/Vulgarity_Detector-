    "Creating a multiclass Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier to detect and classify images containing nudity, gore, violence, and vulgar content is a complex task, especially when dealing with unlabelled datasets. Here's a step-by-step guide to tackle this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather Images: Collect a diverse set of images that may potentially contain the classes you want to identify (nudity, gore, violence, vulgar).\n",
    "Unlabelled Data: Since the data is unlabelled, you will need to employ techniques such as unsupervised learning or semi-supervised learning to generate labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Unsupervised Learning for Initial Labelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction: Use pre-trained CNNs (like VGG16, ResNet50) to extract features from images. This step helps in reducing the dimensionality and focusing on important features.\n",
    "Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) on the extracted features to group similar images together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Semi-Supervised Learning for Labelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Labelling: Manually label a small subset of images from each cluster. This small labelled dataset will be used to train an initial classifier.\n",
    "Training Initial Classifier: Train a simple classifier (e.g., logistic regression, SVM) on the manually labelled subset.\n",
    "Pseudo-Labelling: Use the initial classifier to predict labels for the unlabelled images, effectively creating a pseudo-labelled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Training the Multiclass CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: Augment your pseudo-labelled dataset to increase its size and diversity.\n",
    "CNN Architecture: Design a CNN architecture suitable for your task. You can start with a standard architecture and fine-tune it according to your needs.\n",
    "Training: Train the CNN on the augmented, pseudo-labelled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Evaluation and Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set: Split a portion of your pseudo-labelled dataset as a validation set to monitor the training process.\n",
    "Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of your model.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of layers to improve performance."
